                            <p>
                                In the IT field, complex problems could arise, and teamwork would be an ideal strategy. A lot could go wrong; therefore, the collective intelligence and resource pooling of a group would grant better assessed solutions from various viewpoints and technical background, within whether they will hit a roadblock in the future because of this solution and amongst other things such as risk management, pros and cons. Dealing with it individually could be a missed opportunity on skill and knowledge development. It could also affect the quality of the solution in a negative way, where the diverse perspective and technical expertise would positively increase the quality of the solution.

                            <p>Small groups often include individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and areas of skill. This diversity of perspectives can lead to further discussions and innovative solutions. This favor can encourage group members to challenge each other’s assumptions, leading to deeper insights, making it easier to approach the problem as a group.</p>                            
                            <p>Sharing of individual skills, knowledge and expertise allows for promotion of collaborative learning and skill sharing in a small group setting.</p>

                        <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
                            <p>
                                Disagreement is beneficial because it brings a variety of viewpoints/perspectives to the table. It is beneficial when taking on difficult challenges that require a lot of teamwork. When people with different viewpoints challenge each other's ideas and thoughts it sparks innovation and critical thinking among the group. This process often reveals flaws in assumptions and opens a deeper exploration of the problem. Healthy disagreement is an essential part of good-problem solving because it allows the team to develop a larger variety of options to account for, while developing stronger solutions.

                            <p>
                                The best way to manage a group conflict is to take it individually one on one with the person that is missing the meeting(s) and try to understand why the person is missing out.  We would try to resolve it by contacting the absent person, because it could be medically related or something personal. To resolve this issue, we could reschedule the meeting to another day or have a meeting online. If the meeting is important and the missing co-worker cannot attend, we would make sure to provide the information to this person and have a summary of the meeting.
