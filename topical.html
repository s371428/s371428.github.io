                        At Oslo Metropolitan University, diversity is at the of core the university experience. 
                        Working in groups with students from diverse backgrounds, cultures and personalities is 
                        a great opportunity to learn, grow, and excel together. Embracing these differences is 
                        essential for achieving success in a group. Here are a few key factors to take in to 
                        consideration when working in groups.

                    <h2>Diversity</h2>
                    <p>Initial reactions in a small group of strangers may include a mix of curiosity about everyone’s background, 
                    culture, personality, and more to be mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Each group member might find themselves judging or evaluating their own social standing in their assigned 
                    group, such as trying to make a good first impression towards the group.</p>
                    <p>A sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipation">anticipation</a> to work on an objective <!--Link retrieved from en.wikipedia.org-->
                    as a group gives a spark of motivation to show the group that you are engaged.</p>

                    <p>In the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/IT">IT</a> field, <!--Link retrieved from www.techtarget.com-->
                    complex problems could arise, and teamwork would be an ideal strategy. A lot could go wrong; 
                    therefore, the collective intelligence and resource pooling of a group would grant better assessed solutions 
                    from various viewpoints and technical background, within whether they will hit a roadblock in the future 
                    because of this solution and amongst other things such as risk management, pros and cons. Dealing with it 
                    individually could be a missed opportunity on skill and knowledge development. It could also affect the 
                    quality of the solution in a negative way, where the diverse perspective and technical expertise would 
                    positively increase the quality of the solution.</p>

                    <h2>Favors working in a group</h2>
                    <p>Small groups often include individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and areas of skill. This 
                    diversity of perspectives can lead to further discussions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation">innovative</a> solutions. <!--Link retrieved from en.wikipedia.org-->
                    This favor can encourage group members to challenge each other’s 
                    assumptions, leading to deeper insights, making it easier to 
                    approach the problem as a group.</p>                            
                    <p>Sharing of individual skills, knowledge and expertise allows for promotion of collaborative learning and 
                    skill sharing in a small group setting.</p>                   
                    <p>When individuals work towards the same goal, especially as a small group. It gives a higher level of 
                    motivation in terms of engagement and dedication to perform well to the group’s objective.</p>

                    <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
                    <p>Disagreement is beneficial because it brings a variety of viewpoints/perspectives to the table. It is 
                    beneficial when taking on difficult challenges that require a lot of teamwork. When people with different 
                    viewpoints challenge each other's ideas and thoughts it sparks innovation and critical thinking among the 
                    group. This process often reveals flaws in assumptions and opens a deeper exploration of the problem. 
                    Healthy disagreement is an essential part of good-problem solving because it allows the team to develop a 
                    larger variety of options to account for, while developing stronger solutions.</p>

                    <h2>Handling group conflict</h2>
                    <p>The optimal approach to addressing group conflict involves handling it on an individual basis with the person 
                    who has missed the meeting(s). The objective is to comprehend the reasons behind their absence. Efforts would
                    be made to resolve the situation by reaching out to the absent individual, considering that the absence could be due
                    to medical reasons or personal circumstances. To tackle this concern, options like rescheduling the meeting for another
                    day or conducting it online would be explored. In cases where the meeting holds significant importance and the absent
                    co-worker cannot attend, measures would be taken to ensure that the necessary information is provided to them, along with
                    a summary of the meeting.</p>
