                    <p>Accessibility is an essential part of the modern website design. Creating useful websites
                        with lasting designs means taking every potential user in mind. Disability is present in 
                        everyone's lives at some point, so designing for the "outliers" will essentially be
                         designing for everyone.</p>

                    <h2>Accessable Desing</h2>
                    <p>In designing a website, in regards to accessibility, the following choices are important:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide the page-reader with useful "alt" text-descriptions.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the page's style doesn't interfere with visual impairments, like low 
                            contrasts on text and useful features.</li>
                        <li>Make sure buttons and other interactable features are easy to distignuish and use.</li>

                    <h2>Accessibility Test</h2>
                    <p>The Topical page was run through the automated accessibility test with the use of Wave-test.</p>
                    <p>As the pictures below shows, the test came back with one error, and four alerts. The test was 
                        conducted while the page was 90% finished, so that the test could give important feedback during 
                        the development.</p>

                is due to an empty form label, and the 4 alerts are repetetive alternative texts for images.

                 <img class="left-image" alt="A screenshot of the Wave-test. Showing
                 1 error, 0 contrast-errors and 4 alerts." src="/media/eksamen-wavetest1.png">

                <div class="text-child">
                    <p>Under the details of the wave-test, we are given the reason behind the one error and four alerts.
                        The error comes from an empty form label, refering to the dropdown-menu on phone-screens. Since 
                        the use of the label tag is not supposed to have visible text in this case, this error can be 
                        ignored as long as a "title" attribute is used on the tag, so that, if hovered on, it provides 
                        text if the user should be in need.</p>                            
                    <p>The four alerts refere to the fact that all the pictures on the page have identical alternative
                        descriptions for screen-readers etc. This stems from the fact that the page was lacking it's
                        last finish, and every picture's alt= was filled with a generic filler-text. The test did 
                        therefore help us to remember this before the site is "shipped."</p>

                <div class="text-child">
                    <h2>Using the feedback</h2>
                    <p>After having used the feecback from the Wave test, we had no more alerts. As shown in the picture
                        below.</p>
                    <img class="right-image" alt="Wave test results after fixing alt-texts" src="/media/eksamen-wavetest3.png">              
                    <p>But automated tests like Wave test are limited in their scope, and so common practices play
                        an important part in designing for Accessibility.

                    <h2>Common Practices</h2>
                    <p>The automated tests are great for quick feedback, but they have limits to how much accessability
                         they can detect. For everything else, common practices are implemented to increase accessability.</p>
                    <p>In order to be accessible for a wider audience, our website changes based on the size of your device. 
                        If you don't own a computer, you can access the site via your phone, and the website will follow our
                         specified style for "narrow-screen".
                    </p>
                    <img class="right-image" alt="Code showing the use of different visuals when using narrow device" 
                    src="/media/eksamen-code-phonescreensize.png">
                    <img class="right-image" alt="Showcase of the contrast used in the visual style." 
                    src="/media/eksamen-showcase-contrast.png">
                    <p>Another accessibility feature of our page is the contrast in the visual style. Since anyone can have a 
                        tiresome day, direct sunlight or other impairments, the importance of clean and easy visuals for the 
                        content we want to convey to the user can not be understated. To ensure contrast on our page, we have 
                         chosen color for text and buttons to be easy to discern from their enviorments. Combine this with 
                         a dark background, and our content is more accessible. </p>
